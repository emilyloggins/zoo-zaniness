Imagine a scenario in which you are writing an application in which you need to classify any animal species as ground-based, air-based, or water-based. Also consider that animal species can be any combination of those classifications.

To make our code base as flexible as possible, we define the properties and behaviors of each classification (or description) into an interface.
